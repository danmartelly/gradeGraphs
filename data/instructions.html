<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>If there is a yellow line, students were asked to trace that yellow line. Otherwise, students were asked to plot based on the equation shown. The blue line is the student's plot. In the spaces below the graph, input the grade you believe the student deserves. If you give less than 100%, please briefly explain why in the comments box.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This website was made by me, Daniel Martelly. By grading the graphs shown on the site, you're helping me with my MEng thesis. The purpose of my MEng thesis is to find a way to automatically grade graphs drawn by students online. The goal is to eventually integrate such a system into online teaching websites such as the 6.01 tutor. Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>
